 abstract = {This paper defines hedonic consumption as those facets of consumer behavior that relate to the multisensory, fantasy and emotive aspects of product usage experience. After delineating these concepts, their theoretical antecedents are traced, followed by a discussion of differences between the traditional and hedonic views, methodological implications of the latter approach, and behavioral propositions in four substantive areas relevant to hedonic consumption-mental constructs, product classes, product usage and individual differences. Conclusions concern the usefulness of the hedonic perspective in supplementing and extending marketing research on consumer behavior.},

  abstract={This article examines spatial autocorrelation in transaction prices of single-family properties in Dallas, Texas. The empirical analysis is conducted using a semilog hedonic house price equation and a spherical autocorrelation function with data for over 5000 transactions of homes sold between 1991:4 and 1993:1. Properties are geocoded and assigned to separate housing submarkets within metropolitan Dallas. Hedonic and spherical autocorrelation parameters are estimated separately for each submarket using estimated generalized least squares (EGLS). We find strong evidence of spatial autocorrelation in transaction prices within submarkets. Results for spatially autocorrelated residuals are mixed. In four of eight submarkets, there is evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the hedonic residuals for single-family properties located within a 1200 meter radius. In two submarkets, the hedonic residuals are spatially autocorrelated throughout the submarket, while the hedonic residuals are spatially uncorrelated in the remaining two submarkets. Finally, we compare OLS and kriged EGLS predicted values for properties sold during 1993:1. Kriged EGLS predictions are more accurate than OLS in six of eight submarkets, while OLS has smaller prediction errors in submarkets where the residuals are spatially uncorrelated and the estimated semivariogram has a large variance.

  abstract={Using the well-known Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978) hedonic pricing data, this manuscript demonstrates the substantial benefits obtained by modeling the spatial dependence of the errors. Specifically, the estimated errors on the spatial autoregression fell by 44\% relative to OLS. The spatial autoregression corrects predicted values by a nonparametric estimate of the error on nearby observations and thus mimics the behavior of appraisers. The spatial autoregression, by formally incorporating the areal configuration of the data to increase predictive accuracy and estimation efficiency, has great potential in real estate empirical work.

 abstract = {G. C. Haas produced a hedonic study more than 15 years prior to A. T. Court who first published the term hedonics. Haas's application was to agricultural land prices with a particular focus on distance to the city center and city size. Thus, Haas's work has much of the flavor of contemporary urban economics. A reestimation of Haas's model reveals that he did a respectable job in an age before computational machinery was available. The estimation of a new model reveals a tiny value gradient and shows that some of Haas's adjustments to price, especially his time adjustments, were amazingly accurate.},

abstract={The Hedonic Price Method (HPM), also known as hedonic regression, is used for estimating the value of a commodity or the demand for a commodity. The HPM has been extensively used in real estate and housing market research in the recent past. In this paper, we discuss theoretical and methodological developments related to hedonic regression and undertake an examination of use of this methodology in the recent real estate and housing literature. We first define the HPM, and explain the fundamentals behind the methodology. The idea behind the HPM is that the commodities are characterized by their constitute properties, hence the value of a commodity can be calculated by adding up the estimated values of its separate properties. In the second part of the paper, we emphasise that the heterogeneous nature of real estate property justifies the use of HPM for estimating their value or demand. We also take a stock of most cited empirical studies on real estate and housing using the HPM, and classify those into several categories. The classification indicates that neighbourhood characteristics of real estate are relatively over-researched as a determinant of price or rent. It also shows that implicit value of structural characteristics is under-researched. In general, implicit value of environmental amenities in the neighbourhood and air pollution are relatively overresearched. The effect of social factors, i.e. racial segregation and crimes on real estate value is under-researched. (authors's abstract)},
